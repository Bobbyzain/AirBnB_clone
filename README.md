# AirBnB_clone

Developing a foundation for a simplified AirBnB website, Holberton School's project begins with crafting a command-driven console. This console serves as the initial building block, enabling users to manage objects within the website's framework.

Key functionalities of this console include:

Object Creation: Effortlessly bring new objects, such as Users or Places, into existence within the website.
Object Retrieval: Seamlessly access and retrieve existing objects from various storage sources, including files and databases.
Object Manipulation: Perform diverse operations on objects, such as counting, calculating statistics, or other necessary tasks.
Object Modification: Adapt and update object attributes as needed, ensuring website content remains current and accurate.
Object Deletion: Easily remove objects that are no longer relevant or required, maintaining a clean and organized website structure.
This console establishes a robust foundation for subsequent project stages, ultimately aiming to deploy a functional AirBnB website replica.
